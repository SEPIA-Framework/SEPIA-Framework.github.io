# SEPIA Client Widgets

NOTE: The widgets in this folder are basically only used for offline (no SEPIA server) testing.  
  
For more widgets check-out: https://github.com/SEPIA-Framework/sepia-extensions/tree/master/media-player-widgets  
  
SEPIA widgets are for example media-player implementations (mp-[service].html) for different music services etc..
